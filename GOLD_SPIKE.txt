My primary gold spike feature is the hand-to-hand combat system that is present throughout this deliverable. The player is able to throw jab and hook punches at enemies who have the same attacks until the player is defeated or all enemies are defeated. Some secondary features that I am happy to have completed are a random enemy spawn system and a single screen multiplayer mode (the camera took me a while to figure out).
